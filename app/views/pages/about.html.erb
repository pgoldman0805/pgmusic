          Paul began playing at age piano at age 4. Early on,  
          he was surrounded by many different styles of music, ranging from Classical to Jazz to Pop/Rock 
          (bands like The Beatles, Queen, and ABBA were among his parents’ favorites) … and, of course, lots of Russian 
          music. While studying Computer Science and Economics at Northwestern University, Paul realized his real passion was 
          music, so he transferred to Columbia College, from where he graduated in 2011 with a Bachelor of Music in 
          Contemporary Urban Pop. As a student, Paul developed his musical prowess further and 
          performed alongside many established artists including jazz virtuoso Christian McBride, Peter Erskine (drummer 
          for Weather Report), Fred Wesley (trombonist for James Brown), Kevin Eubanks (leader of the Tonight Show Band), and 
          Charlie Sexton (guitarist for Bob Dylan).
