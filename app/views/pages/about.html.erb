          Born in Moscow, Russia, Paul began singing and playing the piano at age 4. From a young age, 
          he was surrounded by many diverse styles of music, ranging from Classical to Jazz to Pop/Rock 
          (bands like The Beatles, Queen, and ABBA were his parents’ favorites)… and plenty of Russian 
          music. Paul formed his first rock band in high school – “The Sharpshooters”. After studying 
          Computer Science and Economics at Northwestern University, Paul realized his real passion was 
          music and transferred to and graduated from Columbia College with a Bachelor of Music in 
          Contemporary Urban Pop. While still a student, Paul performed with many established artists 
          including jazz virtuoso Christian McBride, Peter Erskine (drummer for Weather Report), Fred 
          Wesley (trombonist for James Brown), Kevin Eubanks (leader of the Tonight Show Band), and 
          Charlie Sexton (guitarist for Bob Dylan).

          Besides performing, Paul is also a private music instructor who teaches piano, ear training, and 
          musicianship to students of all ages. Paul instills in his students a passion for learning, playing,
          and understanding different types of music. He elegantly communicates the nuances of each style and 
          guides his students to develop their own methods of understanding concepts such as rhythm, harmony, 
          and improvisation. Most of all, Paul loves helping his students realize their own musical goals with 
          maximum efficiency. His pupils have the privilege of receiving a customized version of a song of their
